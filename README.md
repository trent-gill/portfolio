**Course Description**:  

_In about five sentences, describe why this course exists, what will be covered, and how it fits into the rest of the field/area’s curriculum.  Please reference the Course Description as listed in the Course Catalog._

**Course Goals**:  

_What are the general outcomes the course designed to achieve? How will they contribute to the students professionally? Course goals are usually broad and general._

**Learning Outcomes**:  
_Learning outcomes are specific and measurable.  They specify, at the minimum, what students are expected to **know** and be able to **demonstrate** upon successful completion of the course.  Think of the kinds of evidence you can collect to assess student learning._

·     
_Use Bloom’s taxonomy (http://www.teachthought.com/learning/249-blooms-taxonomy-verbs-for-critical-thinking/) to identify the focus of your learning outcomes, then select appropriate and measurable action verbs such as **“compare and contrast,” “evaluate,” “employ,” and “analyze.”**_

·     
_Do not use verbs such as “understand,” “learn” and “know” in your learning objectives because these words are too broad and cannot be measured._  

·     
_Put learning outcomes under categories if you have a long list of outcomes._

·     
_Consider including how each Learning Outcome will be assessed._

### Texts and Materials:

_List all of the text(s), materials, and any software for the course.  Be specific as to whether the item is required, recommended, or optional. It is not mandatory to have a required text for your course.  Follow the format customary to your discipline._

_If you have a long list of readings, please use an Appendix at the back of the syllabus._  
  

### Teaching Philosophy:

_Telling students what teaching methods you will use in class and the rationale behind them will help them set realistic expectations. Providing your rationale can decrease student resistance to teaching methods that they may be less familiar and can increase their confidence in the processes in the course._

### Expectations:

_Consider telling students what you expect them to do, both in class and outside of class. Although some expectations may seem self-evident, you are more likely to have students meet your expectations when you state them explicitly. Students have a better chance of being successful when they know precisely what you expect.  Instructors usually include their expectations regarding attendance, class workload, when students should complete the assigned readings, and participation._

_Consider discussing classroom expectations with the students during the first day of class and having the entire class come up with a set of classroom policies or expectations._

_In addition to your expectations for the students consider including what they can expect from you.  Specifically expectation for responding to e-mails (example: Up to 24 hours on weekdays and 48 hours on weekends) and time to return graded assignments._

### Final Grade:

_It is important to be specific about your grading system.  Avoid long paragraphs; use headings, numbers, and bullets to chunk information._

_Clarify whether your system is point based, weighted, percentage, letter based, and whether there will be any adjustment to the final grade, either linear or Gaussian distribution (curved).  Be specific about the cutoff for each letter grade and whether these are predetermined or may be adjusted._

### University Policies

_In this section, include the mandatory University policies. (Examples are provided below.)_

#### Academic Integrity

_There is not specific language for the Academic Integrity policy to be included in the syllabus. It is good to become familiar with the policy and describe it in your own words._

Cheating is strictly prohibited, because it devalues the degree you are working hard to get. It is your responsibility to protect your educational investment by knowing and following the rules. For specific definitions on what constitutes cheating, review the Student’s Guide to Academic Integrity.
 

To be successful in this class, all work on exams and quizzes must be yours and yours alone.  You may not receive outside help. On examinations and quizzes you will never be permitted to use your notes, textbooks, calculators, or any other study aids. Should you see someone else engaging in this behavior, I encourage you to report it to myself or directly to the Office of Academic Integrity Programs. That student is devaluing not only their degree, but yours, too. Be aware that it is my professional obligation to report academic misconduct, which I will not hesitate to do. Sanctions for academic misconduct can include expulsion from the University and an F in this course, so don’t cheat. It’s simply not worth it.


#### Religious Observance

It is the policy of the University to excuse the absences of students that result from religious observances and to reschedule examinations and additional required classwork that may fall on religious holidays, without penalty.

#### Reasonable Accommodation Policy

_There is not specific language for the Reasonable Accommodation policy to be included in the syllabus.  It is good to become familiar with the policy and describe it in your own words.  Including the link to Disability Resources Center is encouraged.


Any student in this course who has a disability that may prevent him or her from fully demonstrating his or her abilities should contact me personally as soon as possible so we can discuss accommodations necessary to ensure full participation and facilitate your educational opportunities.


**Title IX Resources and Reporting Requirement**

For any concerns regarding gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, or stalking, the University offers a variety of resources. To learn more or to report an incident, please contact the Sexual Misconduct Office. Also, please be advised that a professor/GA/TA is required to report instances of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination to the Sexual Misconduct Office.  

**Adjustments for Pregnancy/Childbirth Related Issues**
