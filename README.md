# Trent Gill - Dossier

Welcome, student services colleagues! This online portfolio documents my work as an academic advisor in Student Services since October, 2017.

I have prepared this dossier in expectation that you will review my continuing appointment as an academic advisor in accordance with section 7.5 of BUFAâ€™s collective agreement. I have made every effort to include documents, resources, and reports that represent my professional contributions since November, 2017.

This website includes the following:

* The Academic Advisor position description with thorough explanations for how I met each part of the job;
* Resources, programs, and reports of projects I have helped implement since joining Student Services;
* Communication from colleagues, including letters of support from a variety of offices I regularly work with;
* A summary of professional development undertaken during my 2-year period in the role.

The last two years have been a rewarding and enjoyable experience as a new academic advisor and as a member of the Student Services team. I believe that I have adjusted quickly and have contributed to the ongoing success of several programs around advising and student support. Moreover, working with students motivates me to continue learning and to do whatever I can to support them in the pursuit of their academic goals.

I am proud to be a Brandon University alumnus and for the work that I do daily to help make Brandon University a superior learning environment for students. I look forward to continuing to learn from and work with all of you in the years to come.

Regards,

Trent Gill
