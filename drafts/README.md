# Trent Gill - Dossier

Welcome, student services colleagues! This online portfolio documents my work as an academic advisor in Student Services since October, 2017.

I have prepared this dossier in expectation that you will review my continuing appointment as an academic advisor in accordance with section 7.5 of BUFA’s collective agreement. I have made every effort to include documents, resources, and reports that represent my professional contributions since November, 2017.

This website includes the following:

* The Academic Advisor position description with thorough explanations for how I met each part of the job;
* Resources, programs, and reports of projects I have helped implement since joining Student Services;
* Communication from colleagues, including letters of support from a variety of offices I regularly work with;
* A summary of professional development undertaken during my 2-year period in the role.

The last two years have been a rewarding and enjoyable experience as a new academic advisor and as a member of the Student Services team. I believe that I have adjusted quickly and have contributed to the ongoing success of several programs around advising and student support. Moreover, working with students motivates me to continue learning and to do whatever I can to support them in the pursuit of their academic goals.

I am proud to be a Brandon University alumnus and for the work that I do daily to help make Brandon University a superior learning environment for students. I look forward to continuing to learn from and work with all of you in the years to come.

Regards,

Trent Gill

## About

My role in student services is academic advising. It is my responsibility to support students in pursuit of their academic goals. I am an educator and a facilitator to the learning process inherent to academic advising. Common duties include:

* Providing individual and group assistance to students regarding degree options, requirements, and progress; use of advising resources; and academic standing
* Liaising with and make referrals to other Brandon University offices and Departments as well as community resources (as required)
* Promoting advising through participation in Student Services and Brandon University programming and events
* Serving as an institutional resource and contact for students who need support for internal and external appeal processes

## Advising Philosophy

As an academic advisor at Brandon University, my goal is to help create a learning environment in which students can fully realize themselves as learners, future professionals, citizens, and people.

My advising philosophy is a work in progress. I am eager to learn more and make changes as I gain more experience, consult with senior advisors, and undertake professional development. Most importantly, my philosophy will evolve as I learn from students who communicate their learning needs, challenges, and opportunities to me.

Following developments in professional academic advising, I see myself as an educator whose primary role is to facilitate learning among Brandon University’s students. Today’s post-secondary learners face complex decisions about their education and how to navigate our institutions in order to pursue their goals _and_ create a successful life. I encourage students to think critically about how they define success, how their families and communities define success, and how our learning institutions define success. Students must create an educational plan that aligns with their interests, their goals, their values, and their personal definitions of success. In my capacity as an advisor, helping students think at a deeper level about these choices is at the heart of everything I do.

### Advising as Integrated Learning

The framework for my advising practice is influenced by a variety of sources, including Marc Lowenstein’s [theory of advising as integrative learning](https://dus.psu.edu/mentor/2014/08/toward-a-theory-of-advising/). In this theory, he identifies six guiding principles that help me think about my role and my responsibilities in academic advising:

> 1. Advising is an academic endeavor. Its purposes are specific to institutions of higher learning.
2. Advising enhances learning and at its core is a locus of learning and not merely a signpost to learning.
3. The learning that happens is integrative and helps students make meaning out of their education as a whole.
4. The student must be an active rather than passive participant in the process. The students has the task of constructing an education with the advisor serving as a facilitator.
5. Advising is transformative, not transactional.

Lowenstein’s general principles, outlined here, are useful for any advisor because they specify essential characteristics of advising as a _distinct_ process and practice from other educational professionals, such as classroom instructors, personal counselors, and educational administrators. Although there is clearly overlap between the duties of various roles in student support and administration, it is useful to make distinctions in order to specifically understand why students consult academic advisors in the first place, and what those students can expect to learn through the advising process.

Furthermore, the theory of integrative learning is a _normative_, or _prescriptive_, theory. It instructs rather than explain. This means that it does not necessarily attempt to understand the practice of advising — the emphasis is more on creating _guiding principles_ and outlining what advising should or ought to be. Although the reality doesn’t always align with our ideals, as we will see, our guiding principles serve as a foundation for my interactions with students and with Brandon University.

### Academic Advising at Brandon University

In NACADA’s Statement of Core Values for academic advisors, the third value speaks to the broader learning environment in which advising occurs: “Advisors are responsible to their institutions.” This core value can be understood in a variety of ways. For example, as an academic advisor at Brandon University, part of my role is to explain and confirm the inherent value of a BU degree, and the value of post-secondary study more broadly. This is one way in which I am “responsible to my institution.” Other ways I am responsible to my institution include:

* Doing the job that the university expects me to do
* Working with other members of the institution in a productive way
* Remaining fair-minded with issues of personnel, faculty, curriculum planning, and institutional strategy
* Contributing to the institution’s success above and beyond my official responsibilities
* Representing Brandon University in the community
* Serving students according to the needs of the institution

While all of these are important, I want to emphasize the importance of the last point. In particular, this means advising must be _adapted_ to the context of Brandon University in its current state. Certain services I must provide to students are related to institutional needs.

For example, students often consult me and other academic advisors at Brandon University for a degree audit, or a degree plan, to ensure that they are eligible to graduate or to ensure that they are taking the right courses to make progress in their degree program. While other universities may have degree audit software for this purpose, at Brandon University, we have advisors. Therefore, because of our context, advisors are the primary resource for students in need of this particular service. In order to effectively serve my institution at this point in time, then, I must make this essential operation a priority in both my interactions with students and my daily tasks.

Degree auditing is a service that I am happy to provide, and it is one that is highly appreciated by students. It is rewarding and valuable, and I also enjoy teaching it to students. However, degree planning and subsequent scheduling of courses does tend to be more transactional than transformative or educational. It can also create overly simplistic perceptions of advising within the university community. In other words, it can contribute to the perception that advising is _only_ about checking degree progress and choosing courses, which are largely transactional services.

Because of the context that I have described above, advising at Brandon University can also be more prescriptive than collaborative. While I see myself as a facilitator to the student’s learning, often I have to take a more direct approach — in other words, “instructing” students on what courses they should take to complete the requirements of their program. Nonetheless, whenever possible, I encourage students to think more broadly about themselves as learners than following the prescriptive, procedural methods I use. I see value in this dualistic approach because we are trying to educate students to think critically and analytically about decisions, whether those choices are related to their academics, their careers, or their personal lives. It is important for students to recognize that the process is just as important as the outcome, and that is true in both academic advising and their personal lives.

Brandon University’s demographics can also explain other aspects of my approach to academic advising. For example, we work with a lot of first-generation students — students who are the first in their families to attend university — and students with below average academic backgrounds. Therefore, my role is to educate these students on the basics and norms of a university education, and how to effectively make the transition from high school. I emphasize these teaching moments in advising because _ is crucial to _decision-making_. Most students define graduation as success — but if they first understand the purpose of the curriculum, then their chances of success increase.

My role, then, includes educating students on what has been referred to as the _hidden curriculum_ — a set of values, norms, attitudes, and perspectives that are unintended but nonetheless part of any formal learning experience. I emphasize the positive aspects of the hidden curriculum — that it cultivates a critical approach toward living and attitudes towards learning that will stay with students well after they’ve received their degrees.

Holistic and Developmental Advising
… By creating a supportive learning community through academic advising, we are trying to build the confidence and professional development of students as whole people, and give them the skills to manage their work and life at Brandon University and beyond.

## Advising Job Description

This position reports to the Associate Vice-President (Student Services and Enrolment Management) and University Registrar. The position may include duties as follows:

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Participate in the development and implementation of pre-enrolment and on-going advising programs to assist students with academic, personal, social, vocational, and financial concerns;</div>

Our primary pre-enrollment advising program, now known simply as “New Student Advising,” has been mandatory for new students since I joined student services in 2017. As one of four advisors, two of whom advise full-time, I played a significant role in ensuring that new students had some form of advising before their first year at Brandon University. As a team, we advised over 500 new students for the 2018/19 academic year. Clearly, this would not have been possible without a team effort. According to my own tracking, I individually advised 171 new students — students who were registering for the first time and could not register until they saw an advisor. 171 is approximately half of the total number of students I advised during that same time period, which was 332.

A new initiative for 2018/19 was the development and implementation of “self-advising,” which we also referred to as “e-mail check-in with an advisor.” This option was, in theory, for students who did not need as much support in choosing courses. This new option was necessary to accommodate the volume of new students who were trying to access advising. It was also effective for students who knew what they were doing and did not need individual support.

In practice, the “e-mail check-in” was nonetheless a serious time commitment on behalf of the advising team. Between myself and Alex, we monitored and delegated the e-mail inbox in order to ensure that students were helped as soon as possible. Working with students over e-mail sometimes made the process more efficient; other times, it involved a lot of emailing back and forth, and a lot of long, explanatory emails.

By the beginning of the 2018/19 academic year, I had corresponded with 30 students using the “self-advising” option. Although the volume relative to the total is lower, it was necessary for managing appointments and expectations for students who were eager to register.

I also prepared a report analyzing the successes and challenges of the self-advising option.

Our on-going advising consists primarily of one-on-one appointments made through Student Services. We also take walk-ins during key times of year. Since starting at student services, I have had 571 advising interactions, the majority of which were one-on-one appointments.

I have prepared a more comprehensive advising report so you can review the statistics as they pertain to the volume of students accessing advising through student services.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Provide information about and undertake referral counselling to appropriate resources both on and off campus</div>

As an advisor, it is important that I am aware and informed of resources for students both on and off-campus.

In particular, I make referrals depending on the context. For example, if a student is experiencing personal and emotional distress, they may be referred to our personal counselors in Student Services. If they need guidance around fundamental academic skills such as writing, math, and study strategies, they may be referred to the appropriate professional associate in the academic skills centre. If they need accommodations for an accessibility need, I refer them to Student Accessibility Services. If a student needs to reapply for admission to the university, or if they did not defer their admission and want to start again, I walk them through the process and ensure that they are in contact with the Admissions Office. It is also important that students who are transferring courses are aware of the status of their transfer evaluations.

Some students require more in-depth career planning and more information about how to apply for a job, how to write an effective resume, and how to find work experience. For those students, it is essential that the meet with Doug Pople, Career Planning and Placement Officer. For students who want to prepare themselves to enter the workforce, they should also seek out co-op opportunities through Kelly Mitton, Co-operative Program Coordinator.

For questions around Letters of Permission and problems with student’s records, I act as a liaison between the student and the Registrar’s Office. Whenever there is a problem with a credit on a student’s transcript, I go to the Registrar’s Office for either clarification or to correct the problem, which usually have a simple explanation. I also seek clarification around degree requirements in old calendars and various other issues that inevitably arise when advising students on specific requirements. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work to ensure that the university operates effectively for students, and I play an active role in that.

It is just as common for me to make referrals to department chairs, Deans, and professors. There are an uncountable number of scenarios for which students need to be regularly in contact with their department. For example:

* Course cycling (“Will this required course be offered again? When?”)
* Degree substitutions and waivers (“Can I use these courses instead?”)
* Advanced placement (“I’m transferring in from another university but don’t have my courses evaluated yet. Can I take upper year courses?”)
* Upper-level course advising (“Should I take 15.453 Neurochemistry of Therapeutics or 15.470 Genomics & Bioinformatics?”)
* Pre-requisites (“I don’t have the prerequisite. Can I take this course?”)
* Second degree

I also refer students who are in programs with faculty advisors, such as Business Administration, Nursing, Psychiatric Nursing, Education, and Music.

In terms of off-campus resources, the primary referrals I make are around academic upgrading. If students are unable to take our 090 courses, or if there are barriers preventing them from doing so (like affordability), it is important that they are aware of other options for completing high-school-level courses in order to meet the prerequisites for our 100-level Science and Math courses. In particular, the Brandon Literacy Council and Manitoba Education & Training offered individualized study options for students who need academic upgrading. The ACC Adult Collegiate also teaches Grade 9-12 courses in Science and Math that are the equivalent of Biology 40S, Physics 40S, Chemistry 40S, and Pre-Calculus 40S.

Students are also looking for options for online courses. I explain to these students that BU does not recruit students on the premise of offering online courses as we are primarily an on-campus, face-to-face university. There are unforeseen circumstances, however, in which students cannot attend classes on-campus or cannot attend during certain times of day. Also, students are looking for ways to make progress in their degrees by taking summer courses. In these cases, I walk them through the process for finding online courses, requesting a letter of permission, and applying to be a visiting student at a university that offers online courses. I also serve as the primary resource for assessing whether the course’s transfer credit will meet a requirement within the student’s degree.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Serve as an advocate for students and groups of students;</div>

As an advisor, my primary form of advocacy occurs when working with students who are going through appeal processes. Students consult me on how to write their appeal letters and how to improve their academic standing so they can remain students at the university.

Students who are using provincial, federal, or sponsored funding for their education request reports from academic advisors in order to support their progress in a degree program at Brandon University. In order to write these letters, I have to complete a thorough review of the student’s academic history, discuss with them their reasons for needing more time to complete their degree, and complete an academic plan that specifies their remaining course requirements. Examples of these letters and reports can be found here:

* Example 1
* Example 2

When I hear back from these students, the majority of them are successful in their appeals. Students are appreciative of academic advisors in these scenarios because we offer direct institutional support that they can use when dealing with external organizations.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Participate in the development, maintenance, and assessment of student support systems and programs</div>

In the fall semester of 2018, I was one of several early alert advisors in Student Services who were available to students who under-performed on the first midterm test or assignment in high-enrollment, high-failure courses. The purpose of early alert advising is not to replace the support of faculty and staff that already exists but to strengthen the support provided. This was an important learning experience in becoming more versatile as an advisor. It is designed to help get students back on track by giving them an overview of the resources and services they can use to enhance their learning.

The shared goal of retention programming and academic advising is to create a learning environment in which students can reach their full potential. We want to ensure that students are in programs and courses that align with their strengths, values, and long-term goals. Once they begin those programs, they will inevitably encounter challenges. If students are not successful in their learning, it is our role as a learning community is to examine why, and to reach out to those students to discuss possible solutions.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Perform such other duties as may be assigned by the Associate Vice-President (Student Services and Enrollment Management) and University Registrar through consultation with the incumbent.</div>

I have served on two hiring committees while in Student Services. The first was for a 1-year term of Indigenous Student Success Officer. The second was for the Student Accessibilities Associate which was successfully filled by Morganna Malyon in July of 2018.

I am also eager to participate in any Student Services event that requires additional help, unless it conflicts with my schedule. In the past, I have done group tours and presentations for prospective students. I have also been an usher at convocation and a volunteer at Homecoming 2018.

I have also helped out at orientation, recruitment, and retention events such as Battle on the Border, Exam Study Relief, and Information Sessions. I do not perceive this work as “other duties as assigned” but rather essential to the continued success of the university in attracting and retaining students. As an advisor, it is also important for me to create a reputation for being reasonably available and present to students, faculty, staff, and members of the Brandon University community.

## Advising Syllabus

The purpose of the academic advising syllabus is to inform students of the learning outcomes, expectations, and process of working with an academic advisor at Brandon University.

I created this resource so advisors can work from a shared understanding of advising in Student Services. It was created in consultation with Alex Braun and Laurie Schewchuk.

### What is Academic Advising?

Advising is grounded in the teaching and learning objectives of higher education. Academic advisors at Brandon University work with students to develop an educational plan and to make meaning of their learning experiences. It is the process through which students consciously assess their goals, interests, and abilities to create and refine a formal learning strategy. The purpose of advising is to guide and support students in crafting a fulfilling education that complements their self-assessment.

By engaging in the advising process, students should become more autonomous, empowered, informed, and successful in their intellectual and professional pursuits. Students will be equipped to make decisions and solve problems specific to their academic progress.

### Academic Advising Fundamentals

Advisors at Brandon University have a variety of professional backgrounds and may use different approaches for advising. However, we agree on the following principles of academic advising.

* Advising is a teaching and learning process that has its own curriculum, pedagogy, and learning outcomes.
* Advising plays an important role in students’ experience of university education.
* Advising is a collaborative process in which students’ active participation is essential.
* Advising supports decisions for students whose purposes for post-secondary studies vary according to their self-assessment. Some examples include intellectual curiosity, engaged citizenship, career preparation, professional flexibility, economic mobility, and personal growth.

### Learning Outcomes

Students have several reasons for consulting an academic advisor. In general, though, academic advisors expect that students will learn how to:

* assess their interests, strengths, and goals to inform program, course, and career selection
* seek out opportunities and experiences that confirm or invalidate their long-term goals
* create an educational plan based on strengths, goals, interests, and values
* use information from diverse sources to support the decision-making process
* make meaning of their education and describe the purpose of their learning experiences
* articulate transferable skills (intellectual and practical competencies) acquired through formal and informal learning, including: how to problem solve, how to research, how to explain and communicate, and how to think critically.

### Advisor Responsibilities

Advisors at Brandon University will:

* discuss program and course options available to students at Brandon University
* help students develop an educational plan that fits each individual’s goals, abilities, and values
* stay informed of regulations, policies, and procedures that affect how students progress through an academic program (degree requirements, appeal processes, course sequencing, academic standing, etc.)
* demonstrate how to use advising resources, including registration guides, academic calendar(s), and online registration system
* teach students how to check degree progress using the appropriate resource
* make referrals to others, when appropriate, throughout the advising process
* help students understand how GPA is calculated and how it affects academic standing
ensure that all communication regarding the student’s academic performance remains confidential.

### Student Responsibilities

As a student, you will:

* commit to being an active and engaged learner
* assume responsibility for your choices, studies, and program requirements
* assess your abilities, interests, values, and goals to understand how they intersect with educational pathways
* have an open mind about learning and implementing new strategies for academic success
* research volunteer, co-op, education, and employment opportunities that complement your studies and support your long-term goals
* have realistic expectations for your academic workload.

### Key Resources

Through academic advising, students should expect to gain a working knowledge of the following resources.

* Academic Calendar
* Registration Guide
* Completed Semester Slot Schedule
* Course Syllabi
* Important Dates/Deadlines (Add/Drop, Voluntary Withdrawal)
* Final Exam Schedule
* Degree Worksheets
* Academic Integrity Policy

### Statement on Indecision

“Research shows that students who enter college without a major, and take the time to explore their options, will graduate within the same time frame as students who enter with a major and then, on average, change majors twice” (Gordon).

### Meeting with Your Advisor

Students should meet with an academic advisor whenever they need help navigating the post-secondary system. You are required to see an academic advisor when you are registering for your first courses. Other times you might want to see an academic advisor include:

* when you are considering making a course change and you aren’t sure how it will affect your eligibility to graduate
* when you need help determining entrance requirements for other programs
* when you want to take a course elsewhere and you want to know which courses transfer and how they fit within your Brandon University degree
* when you need to check your degree progress or your timeframe for graduation.

Before an advising appointment, you should:

* take a look at the current registration guide and the academic calendar
* jot down courses you think you will need for your degree, and courses that you are interested in
* consider what other commitments might be involved in your academic day (work, family, etc.)
* be prepared to discuss course options, address academic problems or concerns, make decisions about the upcoming semester, and explore major/minor options
arrive on time for your advising appointment.
